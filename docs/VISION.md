# Enso App — Product Vision

## The Problem

Modern life is a Lotus trap. Infinite scroll, instant gratification, dopamine-optimized feeds — all designed to capture attention and extract value. The result: chronic distraction, anxiety without action, intentions without follow-through.

People know what they should do. They don't do it. The gap between knowing and doing grows wider. Self-help apps add more tasks, more tracking, more guilt. They treat symptoms, not causes.

**The real problem:** People are disconnected from their own hierarchy of needs. They chase esteem while their bodies deteriorate. They seek self-actualization while their relationships crumble. They build second brains while their primary brains atrophy.

## The Solution

**Enso is a mirror, not a manager.**

Write freely. The AI watches, learns, reflects. It doesn't tell you what to do — it shows you what you're already telling yourself. It tracks the gap between your words and your actions. It surfaces where your foundation is cracking.

### Core Loop

```
Write → AI Observes → Patterns Emerge → Insights Surface → Action Follows → Write
```

The journal is the interface. Everything else is infrastructure.

### The Hierarchy System

Based on Maslow, adapted for modern life:

**Level 1: PHYSIOLOGICAL (Body)**
- Sleep quality and consistency
- Nutrition and hydration
- Physical movement
- Shelter and environment

**Level 2: SAFETY (Stability)**
- Financial security
- Health maintenance
- Routine and structure
- Reduced chaos/uncertainty

**Level 3: BELONGING (People)**
- Close relationships
- Community connection
- Communication patterns
- Social nourishment

**Level 4: ESTEEM (Growth)**
- Skill development
- Achievement and progress
- Confidence building
- Recognition and respect

**Level 5: SELF-ACTUALIZATION (Purpose)**
- Alignment with values
- Creative expression
- Contribution to others
- Becoming who you're meant to be

### Key Insight

**You can't skip levels sustainably.**

If you're sleep-deprived (L1), your relationships suffer (L3). If you're financially stressed (L2), your growth stalls (L4). Enso tracks where you're overreaching and where your foundation needs work.

## Principles

### 1. Journal-First
The journal is sacred. No templates forced. No gamification. Just writing. Everything else derives from what you write.

### 2. AI as Infrastructure
The AI is not a chatbot. It's not your friend. It's infrastructure — like plumbing. It works in the background. It surfaces insights at the right moment. It doesn't demand attention.

### 3. Honesty Over Comfort
Enso shows you reality, not what you want to see. Your reliability score might be uncomfortable. The hierarchy assessment might be humbling. That's the point.

### 4. Privacy as Default
Your journal is yours. Sharing is opt-in, granular, revocable. No data mining for ads. No selling insights. Trust is non-negotiable.

### 5. Simplicity Over Features
Every feature adds complexity. Complexity adds friction. Friction kills usage. When in doubt, leave it out.

## Success Metrics

**For users:**
- Journaling consistency (days per week)
- Reliability score trend (improving over time)
- Hierarchy balance (attention across levels)
- Self-reported wellbeing

**For the product:**
- Daily active journalers
- Retention at 30/60/90 days
- Entries per user per week
- Time to first insight

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | Approach | Gap |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Day One | Beautiful journaling | No intelligence, no structure |
| Notion | Flexible workspace | Too much flexibility, no guidance |
| Headspace | Guided meditation | Passive, not reflective |
| Noom | Behavior change | Focused only on weight, prescriptive |
| Superhuman | Email productivity | Wrong domain |

**Enso's differentiation:** AI that understands hierarchy of needs + reliability tracking + social synthesis. No one else is doing this.

## The Name

**Enso (円相)** — The Zen circle. Complete in its incompleteness. Drawn in one breath, expressing the moment. A symbol of enlightenment, strength, the universe.

The circle that helps you see yourself clearly.
